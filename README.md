# Pomadoro_Timer
## Winform Application which is used in order to track "pomadoro" study timings
Base level functionality complete, can operate two timers, which rely on hard coded values (25 minutes for Pomadoro, 5 minutes per break)
When a timer is completed a windows system sound will be played and the user presented a message box to make them aware of their timer ending

### Possible functionality expansion in future
Inclusion of date and system time access
Inclusion of rolling timer count instead of binary active/inactive
Inclusion of A small note section, which the user can fill to highlight the current task. 
Text serialization of completed pomadoros, the tasks involved and date/times related logged.
